# Roadmap

1. This app is developed in such way that it is flexible, and new modules can be added easily.
2. If possible, the `useApiCall.jsx` hook can be improved by adding better error handling function.
3. The testing can also categorized into unit test, integration test and uat test.
4. If in the future, the app become large and current folder structure is not suitable and inefficient, we can change the folder according to module, instead of according to file type (as what current folder structure does)
5. The folder structure in this app currently is according to their file type, for example hooks, components, pages and etc. In future, we can also add folder to store files like contexts, utils, and etc.
